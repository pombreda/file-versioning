hello world.....
this works......


This wrapper only exposes the most common operations that librsync provides.
It is not meant to be a full wrapper, but should cover most use-cases.
You can easily extend this wrapper.
Information about librsync is available in it's manual which is linked 
below (I wish I had found this BEFORE writing this wrapper!)
